# new-seasons-market-recipe-scraper
A local PNW grocery store has almost 900 different recipes.


The Python file will have a script that uses Selenium to scrape all of the recipes on the New Seasons Market webpage. I have attached the results in the csv folder. The JSON folder consists of multiple files based on category, of the different recipes and their corresponding link.
